# InstyMatch

The *InstyMatch API* allows users to match **one Job Description** against up to **10 resume files** and obtain a scored result. <br> The result scores are broken up into 3 categories: **Dynamic**, **Static**, and **Distributed**. <br> **Dynamic scores** represent a Resumes qualifications with respect to the Job Description (e.g. how well the Skills section in a Resume match up against the Skills required in the Job Description). <br> **Static scores** are given in respect to the Resume independently (e.g. The higher the education degree achieved or the more prestigious the university then the higher the educational static score). <br> **Total score** is a combination of the Dynamic & Static scores, after which are given the **Distributed scores**, which are a measure of how much each Dynamic & Static section weighed on the resulting Total Score. <br> Lastly a Feedback value is returned with every Resume with feedback from our internal engine as to how one can improve the contents of their Resume.
